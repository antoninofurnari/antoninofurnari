Ego4D is a massive-scale Egocentric dataset of unprecedented diversity. It consists of 3,670 hours of video collected by 923 unique participants from 74 worldwide locations in 9 different countries. The project brings together 88 researchers, in an international consortium, to dramatically increases the scale of egocentric data publicly available by an order of magnitude, making it more than 20x greater than any other data set in terms of hours of footage. Ego4D aims to catalyse the next era of research in first-person visual perception. The dataset is diverse in its geographic coverage, scenarios, participants and captured modalities. We consulted a survey from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics that captures how people spend the bulk of their time. Data was captured using seven different off-the-shelf head-mounted cameras: GoPro, Vuzix Blade, Pupil Labs, ZShades, OR- DRO EP6, iVue Rincon 1080, and Weeview. In addition to video, portions of Ego4D offer other data modalities: 3D scans, audio, gaze, stereo, multiple synchronized wearable cameras, and textual narrations.
