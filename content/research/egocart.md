We investigate the new problem of egocentric shopping cart localization in retail stores. We propose a novel large-scale dataset for image-based egocentric shopping cart localization. The dataset has been collected using cameras placed on shopping carts in a large retail store. It contains a total of 19,531 image frames, each labelled with its six Degrees Of Freedom pose. We study the localization problem by analysing how cart locations should be represented and estimated, and how to assess the localization results. We benchmark two families of algorithms: classic methods based on image retrieval and emerging methods based on regression. [Web Page](http://iplab.dmi.unict.it/EgocentricShoppingCartLocalization/)
