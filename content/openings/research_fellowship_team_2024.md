# Postdoc / Research Fellow Position in Egocentric Vision at the University of Catania

We are seeking a highly motivated candidate for a fully funded postdoc position (Italian Assegno di Ricerca) in Egocentric Vision.

The candidate will join the [FPV@IPLAB research group](https://iplab.dmi.unict.it/fpv/), at the [University of Catania, Italy](http://unict.it) and work on topics related to the detection and characterization of human-object interactions from first person (egocentric) videos.

The goal is to carry out fundamental research and publish its results in main Computer Vision conferences (CVPR, ECCV, ICCV, etc.) and Journals (TPAMI, IJCV, etc.).

The selected candidate will work within the framework of the PRIN PNRR [TEAM](https://sites.google.com/view/prin-pnrr-team) project, with specific focus on understanding human-object interactions from egocentric videos.

Feel free to contact Prof. [Antonino Furnari](mailto:antonino.furnari@unict.it "mailto:antonino.furnari@unict.it") for any further info.

About the Laboratory
--------------------

The [FPV@IPLAB research group](http://iplab.dmi.unict.it/fpv/) mainly focuses on the development of research in Computer Vision and Deep Learning for First Person (Egocentric) vision. The group has [15+ members](https://iplab.dmi.unict.it/fpv/people) and is part of the broader [IPLAB group](https://iplab.dmi.unict.it), counting more than 30 people.

The FPV@IPLAB group has a [track record of previous publications](https://iplab.dmi.unict.it/fpv/research) in prestigious venues (CVPR, ICCV, ECCV, TPAMI, IJCV, ... - a full list is [here](https://iplab.dmi.unict.it/fpv/publications) and several [research projects](https://iplab.dmi.unict.it/fpv/projects) on both fundamental and application-oriented research, in collaborations with several industrial and academic [partners](https://iplab.dmi.unict.it/fpv/partners).

The group aims to provide its members a friendly environment with strong supervision, in which individuals can grow and let their full potential flourish. We regularly organize group meetings and [gatherings outside the lab](https://www.antoninofurnari.it/thelab/) to keep the team motivated and encourage a good work culture.
