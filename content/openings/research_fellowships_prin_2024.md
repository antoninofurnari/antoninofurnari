# Two Research Fellowships (Post-doc Equivalent - Italian Assegno di Ricerca)
We are seeking two highly motivated researchers for fully funded research fellowship positions (Italian Assegno di Ricerca – Post-Doc Equivalent) on topics related to the analysis of Hand-Object Interactions in Egocentric Vision.

The candidate will join the [FPV@IPLAB research group](http://iplab.dmi.unict.it/fpv/), at the [University of Catania, Italy](http://unict.it) and work on topics related to the detection and characterization of human-object interactions from first person (egocentric) videos under the supervision of [Prof. Antonino Furnari](https://www.antoninofurnari.it) and [Prof. Giovanni Maria Farinella](https://www.dmi.unict.it/farinella/).

The goal is to carry out fundamental research and publish its results in main Computer Vision conferences (CVPR, ECCV, ICCV, etc.) and Journals (TPAMI, IJCV, etc.). 

The two positions are in topics related to two recently funded projects: [EXTRA-EYE](https://sites.google.com/view/extraeye) and [TEAM](https://sites.google.com/view/prin-pnrr-team), with specific focus on understanding human-object interactions from egocentric videos. More details on the two open positions are in the following.
 
## Position 1 - Design and Development of Computer Vision Algorithms for the Recognition of Human-Object Interactions
* *Position*: Research Fellow (post-doc equivalent)
* *Location*: University of Catania, Catania, Italy
* *Application Deadline*: 8th January 2024, 12.00 (Italian Time)
* *Link to the Call (with instructions on how to apply)*: https://www.unict.it/it/bandi/ricerca-e-trasferimento-tecnologico/dipartimento-di-matematica-e-informatica-selezione - Feel free to contact [Prof. Antonino Furnari](https://www.antoninofurnari.it) if you need assistance to apply.
* *Duration*: 18 Months (initially 1 year, but it can be renewed for another 6 months)
* *Research Topics*: The research activity will involve the investigation of new approaches for the detection of human-object interactions from egocentric vision, extending the current state of the art to new application scenarios or new dimensions, such as temporal video analysis. The research will be carried out in the context of the PRIN 2022 project "EXTRA-EYE", with close collaboration with partner institutions to achieve the project's objectives.

## Position 2 - Design and Development of Computer Vision Algorithms for the Detection of Objects Useful to Track and Characterization of Human-Object Interactions
* *Position*: Research Fellow (post-doc equivalent)
* *Location*: University of Catania, Catania, Italy
* *Application Deadline*: 8th January 2024, 12.00 (Italian Time)
* *Link to the Call (with instructions on how to apply)*: https://www.unict.it/it/bandi/ricerca-e-trasferimento-tecnologico/dipartimento-di-matematica-e-informatica-selezione-0 - Feel free to contact [Prof. Antonino Furnari](https://www.antoninofurnari.it) if you need assistance to apply.
* *Duration*: 18 Months (initially 1 year, but it can be renewed for another 6 months)
* *Research Topics*: The research activity will focus on the investigation of algorithms for the detection of objects that are relevant to track in videos captured through wearable devices to define semantic summaries for episodic memory retrieval. The research will lead to the extension of existing algorithms and the formalization of new algorithms for the detection and characterization of interactions between users and objects. The research will be carried within the framework of the PRIN PNRR 2022 "TEAM" project, with close collaboration with partner institutions to achieve the project's objectives.

## Admission Criteria
To participate in the call, a master degree in Computer Science or Computer Science Engineering is required. A PhD is not required, but strongly recommended. Previous background in Computer Vision and Deep Learning is also strongly recommended.

## About the Laboratory
The [FPV@IPLAB research group](http://iplab.dmi.unict.it/fpv/) mainly focuses on the development of research in Computer Vision and Deep Learning for First Person (Egocentric) vision. The group has [15+ members](https://iplab.dmi.unict.it/fpv/people) and is part of the broader [IPLAB group](https://iplab.dmi.unict.it), counting more than 30 people.

The FPV@IPLAB group has a [track record of previous publications](https://iplab.dmi.unict.it/fpv/research) in prestigious venues (CVPR, ICCV, ECCV, TPAMI, IJCV, ... - a full list is [here](https://iplab.dmi.unict.it/fpv/publications)) and several [research projects](https://iplab.dmi.unict.it/fpv/projects) on both fundamental and application-oriented research, in collaborations with several industrial and academic [partners](https://iplab.dmi.unict.it/fpv/partners).

The group aims to provide its members a friendly environment with strong supervision, in which individuals can grow and let their full potential flourish. We regularly organize group meetings and [gatherings outside the lab](http://antoninofurnari.it/thelab) to keep the team motivated and encourage a good work culture.

We are in the [EPIC-KITCHENS](http://epic-kitchens.github.io/), [EGO4D](https://ego4d-data.org), and [EGO-EXO4D](http://ego-exo4d-data.org/) teams, three of the most prominent aggregations of researchers aiming to push the boundaries of egocentric vision.
