<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>I am a tenure-track assistant professor at the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.unict.it/">University of Catania</a>.</p> 
<p>I received a PhD degree in Mathematics and Computer Science in 2017 from the University of Catania advised by Prof. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.dmi.unict.it/farinella/">Giovanni Maria Farinella</a> and Prof. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.dmi.unict.it/~battiato/">Sebastiano Battiato</a>, and spent time as a visiting researcher at the University of Texas at Austin advised by <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~grauman/">Prof. Kristen Grauman</a> and at the University of Bristol advised by <a target="_blank" href="https://dimadamen.github.io/">Prof. Dima Damen</a>.</p>

<p>I am part of the <a target="_blank" href="http://iplab.dmi.unict.it">Image Processing Laboratory</a> and the <a target="_blank" href="http://iplab.dmi.unict.it/fpv/">FPV@IPLAB research group</a>.
I am part of the <a target="_blank" href="https://epic-kitchens.github.io/">EPIC-KITCHENS</a>, <a href="https://ego4d-data.org/" target="_blank">EGO4D</a> and <a href="https://ego-exo4d-data.org/" target="_blank">EGO-EXO4D</a> teams. I am an <a href="https://ellis.eu">ELLIS member</a> and an <a href="https://www.ieee.org">IEEE Senior Member</a>.</p>

<p>I teach a Bachelor course on <a href="/teaching/prog1/"> Computer Programming</a> and a Master course on <a href="">Fundamentals of Data Analysis</a> for which I proudly share open source notes <a href="https://antoninofurnari.github.io/fadlecturenotes/">here</a>. I supervised more than 30 bachelor and master theses and supervised/currently supervising 5 PhD students.</p>

<p>I am passionate about making things work, understanding what great minds have discovered in the past and are discovering in the present, and humbly contributing to shaping the technology of the future.</p>

<p>My research focuses on understanding human activity and future intent from egocentric video, and building assistive systems which can support and empower humans.

<!--I am an assistant Professor (RTD-b) at the University of Catania (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.unict.it/">https://www.unict.it/</a>) since 2022.
I received my bachelor's degree and master's degree in computer science (both cum laude) and my PhD in Mathematics and Computer Science in 2010, 2013, and 2017 respectively from the University of Catania. 
I am a member of the IPLAB (<a target="_blank" href="https://iplab.dmi.unict.it/fpv">https://iplab.dmi.unict.it/fpv</a>) research group since 2012 and I have authored two patents and more than 60 papers in international book chapters, international journals and international conference proceedings. 
I served as a contract professor at the Department of Mathematics and Computer science, University of Catania, Italy, since 2017. In these years, I have held courses on Programming Laboratories, Fundamentals of Data Analysis Laboratories, Statistical Laboratory in R, and Social Media Data Analysis.
In April 2021, I have achieved the Italian "Abilitazione Scientifica Nazionale" (ASN) for sectors "01/B1 Informatica" and "09/H1 Sistemi di Elaborazione delle Informazioni".
In 2020 and 2021 I have been guest editor for IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Image Intelligence (TPAMI) with a special issue on "Egocentric Perception". Since 2021, I serve as an associate editor for the Springer "The Visual Computer Journal".
I have been involved in the organization of several international events, such as the Assistive Computer Vision and Robotics (ACVR - https://iplab.dmi.unict.it/acvr2022/) workshop series (since 2016), the International Computer Vision Summer School (ICVSS - https://iplab.dmi.unict.it/icvss) (since 2017), the Egocentric Perception Interaction and Computing (EPIC - https://eyewear-computing.org/) workshop series (since 2018), and the EGO4D workshops and tutorials (since 2022 - https://ego4d-data.org/).
I serve as reviewer for the main international conferences in the fields of Computer Vision, Multimedia and Machine Learning, such as CVPR, ICCV, ECCV, NeurIPS, ICLR, WACV, ACM Multimedia, IJCAI, ICRA, ICPR, ICIAP, and for several journals, including IEEE Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, International Journal of Computer Vision, Pattern Recognition, Computer Vision and Image Understanding, IEEE Circuits and Systems for Videos Technology and Pattern Recognition Letters.
Since 2016, I have held talks at universities, including the University of Bristol (UK), the University of Bern (CH), the University of Essex (UK), ETH (CH), at workshops (EgoApp 2019 in conjunction with BMVC 2019), and tutorials at conferences (ICIAP 2019, VISAPP 2019, VISAPP 2020, VISAPP 2021, ICIAP 2022).
Since 2021, I am co-founder and Chief R&D Officier of Next Vision s.r.l. (http://nextvisionlab.it/), a spin-off of the University of Catania which aims to build innovative Artificial Intelligence technologies to make machines able to perceive and understand the world exploiting fixed, mobile and wearable cameras. -->

<!-- # Research Interests
My research interests concern mainly Computer Vision, with a particular focus on First Person (Egocentric) Vision and future predictions from egocentric vision. I am particularly interested in developing algorithms and systems to assist humans in their daily and work-related tasks through wearable devices equipped with vision capabilities (e.g., smart glasses). Please see <a href="/research/">my research page</a> for more details and research highlights and <a href="/publications/">my publication page</a> for the full list of publications. -->
